---

To install the `installTAK` script from the source use the following commands to install the repository to a folder of your choice:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/myTeckNet/installTAK.git ./installTAK && cd ./installTAK
```
The above command will install the installTAK script in the current directory in a new folder called *installTAK*.  After the repository has been cloned navigate to the *installTAK* directory.
```
cd installTAK
```

If you have not done so already, head to [TAK.gov][tpc], download the [TAK Server][takserver] installation files, and place them in this newly created *installTAK* directory.

Run the following command to display the installation arguments:
```shell
./installTAK
```
Running `installTAK` alone will display the intended command usage. Â For example is the **takserver-5.3-RELEASE4.noarch.rpm** and **takserver-public-gpg.key** are in the installTAK directory run the following:
```shell
./installTAK takserver-5.3-RELEASE4.noarch.rpm
```
For Ubuntu/Debian systems ensure to download the **deb_policy.pol** and place it in the *installTAK* directory.

To enable **FIPS** Certificates append *--fips* at the end of the command.  Custom certificates with stronger algorithms will be generated for use on systems with **FIPS** enabled.  **ATAK** may not support certificates generated with these stronger algorithms.  Use at your own discretion.
```shell
./installTAK takserver-5.3-RELEASE4.noarch.rpm --fips
```

## Installation from Download ZIP
Installation from ZIP requires external repository contents.  Download the **installTAK.zip**.

1. Extract the installTAK.zip

Final directory tree should look like this:
```
installTAK
â”œâ”€â”€â”€lib
â”‚   â””â”€â”€â”€img
```
## Installation Command Examples:
script usage: installTAK [path to TAK Server installer [rpm | deb | zip ]]
```shell
# RPM
./installTAK takserver-*.noarch.rpm
```
```shell
# Ubuntu/Raspberry-Pi
./installTAK takserver-*_ALL.deb
```
```shell
# Docker/Container
./installTAK takserver-docker-*.zip
```

The `installTAK` script will detect the operating system it is being run against to determine the prerequisites needed to install the TAK Server.  After the prerequisites have been installed, it will install the takserver binary or container.  Following a complete installation or deployment of the TAK Server or container the TAK Server wizard will run to complete the remaining steps.

![TAK Wizard Prompt 01](lib/img/takwizard_prompt01.png "Welcome Splash")

In the following prompt, enter the certificate information associated with your organization.  All fields are required, City names with spaces are okay here.

![TAK Wizard Prompt 02](lib/img/takwizard_prompt02.png "PKI Configuration")

If you wish to change the default certificate password, you have the option to do it here.

![TAK Wizard Prompt 03](lib/img/takwizard_prompt03.png "Change Default Certificate Password?")

### [Optional] Certificate Password
If you select **yes** to change the default certificate password, enter your new password here.

![TAK Wizard Prompt 03a](lib/img/takwizard_prompt03a.png "Change Default Certificate Password?")

Enter the name for your Root Certificate Authority (CA); otherwise, if you leave this blank a random name will be generated for you.

![TAK Wizard Prompt 04](lib/img/takwizard_prompt04.png "Root Certificate Authority (CA)")

Enter the name of your Intermediate Certificate Authority (CA), this certificate is used to sign and issue certificates on behalf of the root CA; otherwise, if you leave this blank a random name will be generated for you.

![TAK Wizard Prompt 05](lib/img/takwizard_prompt05.png "Issuing Certificate Authority (CA)")

Certificate enrollment allows you as the TAK Administrator to pass a preconfigured data package (**enrollmentDP.zip**) to users/clients that will prompt the user for credentials needed to authenticate to the TAK Server.  Credentials are managed in the **Manage Users** UI of the TAK Server.  Selecting **yes** here will open TCP Port `8446` inbound for enrollment.

![TAK Wizard Prompt 06](lib/img/takwizard_prompt06.png "Enable Certificate Auto-Enrollment?")

Enabling TAK Server Federation allows you to share data that is owned by the TAK Server to other TAK Servers.  Selecting **yes** here will open TCP Port `9001` for inbound TAK Federation.

![TAK Wizard Prompt 07](lib/img/takwizard_prompt07.png "Enable TAK Server Federation?")

By default the TAK Server accepts connections over **SSL/TLS**.  Additionally, the TAK Server supports the **QUIC** protocol.  Select the appropriate connection type for this TAK Server.

![TAK Connection Types](lib/img/connector_wizard01.png "TAK Server Connection Types")

When certificate enrollment is enabled it opens credentialed access via the API on TCP port `8446`.  The practice of poor passwords and complexity could open this as a potential attack vector for administrative access.  Select the options that are required for your deployment.  Otherwise, selecting none will only allow certificate requests and not access to WebTAK features.

![WebTAK Security Options](lib/img/webtak_options01.png "WebTAK Security Options")

The following prompt provides the configuration summary.  Review this prompt for accuracy, select **Confirm** to commit all changes or select **Reset Wizard** to run through the TAK Wizard again.

![TAK Wizard Prompt 08](lib/img/takwizard_prompt08.png "Configuration Summary")

### [Optional] Certificate Enrollment
If you selected **yes** to enable certificate auto-enrollment, you will be presented with an input to name this TAK Server description connection.  This will be displayed on the TAK Clients as the friendly name.

![TAK Wizard Prompt 09](lib/img/takDP_wizard01.png "TAK Server Description")

If your TAK Server is public facing and has a registered Domain Name and associated record you can select yes to enter the FQDN information here.  Otherwise, selecting **no** will use the ip address for connections.

![TAK Wizard Prompt 10](lib/img/takDP_wizard02.png "Fully Qualified Domain Name")

### [Optional] Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) Connections
If you selected **yes** that this TAK Server supports FQDN Connections, you will be asked how this TAK Server will be trusted.  If you or your organization have a registered Domain Name, select **Local**.  

![TAK Wizard Prompt 10](lib/img/fqdn_wizard01.png "Fully Qualified Domain Name")

Selecting Local will not create a certificate signing request as the local csr can be used or a local one be generated manually.  Click [here][mytecknet-ca] learn more about using a third-party certificate signer.  By default, the TAK Server IP Address is displayed.

![TAK Wizard Prompt 10a](lib/img/fqdn_wizard01a.png "Local Fully Qualified Domain Name")

Selecting **Let's Encrypt** will utilize Let's Encrypt as the public Certificate Authority and will begin the public certificate signing request and issuance.

Before continuing with the **Let's Encrypt** configuration ensure that you allow TCP port 80 into your network by either enabling port forwarding in your router to the TAK Server or cloud service provider (CSP).  Consult your CSP for specific instructions.

![TAK Wizard Prompt 11](lib/img/fqdn_wizard02.png "Let's Encrypt Fully Qualified Domain Name")

Enter the public host record for this TAK Server.  This is commonly associated to the Host Record created in the Domain Name System (DNS) Server or your DNS cloud provider.  Additionally, enter an email to associate this host record; by <u>**default**</u> this email **will not** be shared with *Let's Encrypt* or *Certbot* however is a requirement in the certificate request.

![TAK Wizard Prompt 12](lib/img/fqdn_wizard03.png "Let's Encrypt Fully Qualified Domain Name")

The following prompt provides the configuration summary.  Review this prompt for accuracy, select **Confirm** to commit all changes or select **Reset Wizard** to run through the Let's Encrypt Wizard again.

![TAK Wizard Prompt 13](lib/img/fqdn_wizard04.png "Let's Encrypt Fully Qualified Domain Name")

### Post Installation Files
After successful installation the local *installTAK* repo will delete itself since its only meant to run once.  The TAK Server installation binary and dependencies will be included.  Based on your responses to the TAK Setup Wizard the following files will be created in the current users Linux home directory (/home/$USER) or if root (/root).

- Certificate Auto-Enrollment
    - Yes: enrollmentDP.zip
    - No: caCert.p12
- webadmin.p12

# Federation-Hub
The TAK Server Federation Hub enables forwarding of federated TAK data in a multi-hop setup. The hub supports centralized management of federation 
configuration using a hub and spoke topology. Instead of TAK server federates connecting to each other directly, they connect to a Federation Hub. The 
hub performs connection and trust management, and brokers federated data according to a policy defined by an administrator.  The TAK Server Federation Hub software can be installed and run independently of TAK Server.

## Installation
The `installTAK` script will detect the operating system it is being run against to determine the prerequisites needed to install the TAK Server Federation Hub.  After the prerequisites have been installed, it will install the federation-hub binary or container.  Following a complete installation or deployment of the TAK Server Federation Hub or container the TAK Server Federation Hub wizard will run to complete the remaining steps.

At the following prompt, select the Federation version you wish to support to establish federated connections.  Use the space bar to toggle between on or off.  Selecting Version 2 will open TCP port `9102` and selecting Version 1 will open TCP port `9101` respectively.  Enable the appropriate version to match your federated ecosystem.

![TAK Federation Hub Wizard Prompt 06](lib/img/takfedwizard01.png "Federation Hub Federation Version Support")

Additionally, the TAK Server Federation Hub supports JSON Web Token (JWT) to establish an authenticated federation rather than the mutual client authentication with certificates.  Selecting *Yes* will enable Federation Token Authentication and open TCP port `9103`.  Otherwise, selecting *No* will disable this feature.

![TAK Federation Hub Wizard Prompt 07](lib/img/takfedwizard02.png "Federation Hub Token Federated Support")

The following prompt provides the configuration summary.  Review this prompt for accuracy, select **Confirm** to commit all changes or select **Reset Wizard** to run through the TAK Wizard again.

![TAK Federation Hub Wizard Prompt 08](lib/img/takfedwizard03.png "Federation Hub Configuration Summary")

# Post Installation Tasks
Following the execution of the `installTAK` the **webadmin.p12** is created by default.  This is the TAK Server administrator certificate used to administer the TAK Server from the browser.  This file needs to be copied from the TAK Server to your local workstation.  Most modern operating systems come with secure shell (ssh) installed by default.  If you don't feel comfortable with the command line interface (CLI) tools like [WinSCP](https://winscp.net/eng/index.php) are available.
To copy files from Linux using SCP run the following command:
**Syntax**: scp <username>@<ipaddress>:~/webadmin.p12 <destinationDir>
```shell
scp takadmin@192.168.1.100:~/webadmin.p12 .
```
**Note**: There is a period (.) and a space following the .p12 file extension.  This denotes the current working directory the terminal/shell is in.
```shell
# [Windows] This will copy the webadmin.p12 to the current user's downloads directory
scp takadmin@192.168.1.100:~/webadmin.p12 %userprofile%\Downloads
```
